### What i learned

In this project I learnt a lot about using a no SQL database with firebase and also using firebase for other things such as authentication with google.
I've also gotten a lot of practice with using react states and components in a lot bigger of a project.

Here is my code for signing in and out with google by using firebase authentication.
```js
import {
    getAuth,
    signInWithPopup,
    signOut,
    GoogleAuthProvider,
    onAuthStateChanged,
} from "firebase/auth";

const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState();

async function signIn() {
    const provider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
    await signInWithPopup(getAuth(), provider);
    await setCurrentUser(getAuth().currentUser);
    await navigate("/");
}

function signOutUser() {
    signOut(getAuth());
    setCurrentUser(null);
}
```
